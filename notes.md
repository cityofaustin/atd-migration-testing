### ZENHUB

- release [done // need to remove test code]

## Misc
- test epic foo
- test attachments
- make sure you're gracefully handling zenhub fails on dependency, epics, releases
- on last dry run, some product labels were not colored correctly. looks like they were created by default. how is that possible?
- close all migrated issues BEFORE setting new pipelines (because, positions)
- some issues may not be in zenhubâ€”-must ignore
- don't process issues with the "migrated" label
- filter out epics, pipelines not in our main workspace
- we're not going to fetch closed dependencies, ok??
